Grocery CRUD Spark for CodeIgniter
==================================
This spark is just a package for [**Grocery CRUD**](http://www.grocerycrud.com/), an excellent open source project that adds *CRUD* (C*reate*, R*ead*, U*pdate*, D*elete*) capabilities to any well structured database. This includes a table view for all records, as well as a per row view for individual editing, and a lot of customization options (file upload, callbacks, etc). It's specially handy when dealing with the typical collections (users, products, comments, etc) that need a simple backend to be occasionally managed by a client.

Installation
============
After you install the Spark, you need to move/copy the ``assets`` folder to a publicly accessible place. In most CI installs this can be ``public/assets``. Make sure to add the proper exception in the ``.htaccess`` file, if you're using one.
